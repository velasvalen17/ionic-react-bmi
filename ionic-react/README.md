# Ionic-React-BMI

## Overview

Proof of concept. Web app transformed into a Android app that calculates the Mass-Body-Index using two input fields and two buttons. Inputs are accepted as meters/kgs or feet/lbs.

## Build and deploy

This app was developed using React and Ionic (for the style and behaviour of the components).
Once the web app is finished:

        sudo ionic build
        sudo ionic cap add android
        sudo ionic cap open android

This way the app will be opened in Android Studio and you'll be able to install it to any of your Android devices.
